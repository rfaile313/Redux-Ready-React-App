# Redux Ready React App

On its own, React can only handle component-level state. Sometimes, you'll need to share application level state between components. Redux is a popular solution to share component states with one another. 

The setup for this can be rather complicated and requires a lot of "boilerplate" code to get started. You should be able to clone this repository and work from there as a starting point so you don't have to recreate all that. 

## What's in the box?

Two React components sharing states with a store. 

The app is wrapped in a provider

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Before you start

Run `npm install` - I didn't put the billions of node modules in this repo.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
